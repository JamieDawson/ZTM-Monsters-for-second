# Monsters Rolodex

An app I built in React called Monsters Rolodex. It allows you to search from a list of monsters provided by an API call.

This app is apart of an online course called [Complete React Developer in 2023 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

You can [click here to see the app and test it!](https://ztm-monsters.vercel.app/)
